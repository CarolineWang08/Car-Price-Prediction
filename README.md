# Car-Price-Prediction-

Objective 1
In this term project, we are interested in establishing the statistical significance of the relationship between car price and multiple car features, such as engine volume, fuel type, and mileage, which will be explained in detail in the following section. 
We are also interested in understanding which of the variables have a relatively high magnitude of effect on the outcome variable “price” in terms of the beta coefficient and how well the variance of feature variables explains the variance of  “price”  in terms of coefficient of determination (R-squared).

Objective 2
In this term project, we are also interested in building a predictive model for the outcome mileage  using a set of observed predictors explained below. We aim to identify the best performing set of predictors and find an algorithm with the highest accuracy.
